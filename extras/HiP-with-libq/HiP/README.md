## "HiP"

In this example, we're going to implement a simple greeting protocol
called HiP - Hi Protocol.

`topo_p2p.py` is the python script that generates the following mininet topology..

    [NodeA]ifAB------------ifBA[NodeB]

NodeA will send a broadcast HiP packet via the RAW socket and NodeB
will reply via a unicast HiP packet.

Usage:

- Compile all programmes with `make all` in the current directory. If you get an
  error, make sure to create the `build` directory first using `mkdir build`
- Create the mininet topology using `sudo mn --custom topo_p2p.py --topo mytopo`
- In the mininet console, access node A and B using `xterm A B`  
  (You should have used -Y argument in the SSH command:
  `ssh -Y debian@ip_address_of_your_VM`
- From the xterm consoles, `cd` to `bin` directory and run `./hip s` at node B and
  `./hip c hello` at node A

  Practise and implement new features in the applications.

**NOTE:** The examples we code during plenaries are intentionally simplified and
may contain hardcoded elements. For your assignments, make sure to write clean C
code with proper functions and clear comments.
